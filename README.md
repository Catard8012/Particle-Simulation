Particle Simulation

Overview

This project is a Particle Simulation implemented in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to interact with particles of different colors and adjust parameters like force and radius between different groups of particles.

Features

Interactive UI with a sidebar for controlling particle properties

Adjustable number of particles for each group (Green, Red, White, and Blue)

Configurable interactions (attraction/repulsion forces) between different groups

Adjustable interaction radius for each group

Bounded and unbounded simulation modes

Real-time visual representation of particle interactions on a canvas

Responsive layout with a flexible sidebar

How to Use

Open life.html in a browser.

Use the START/RESET button to initiate the simulation.

Adjust the number of particles for each group using the sliders.

Modify the interaction forces between particle groups to see how they attract or repel.

Use the radius sliders to determine the effective interaction distance.

Toggle the Bounded checkbox to decide whether particles bounce off edges or wrap around.

Drag your mouse over the canvas to apply additional forces to nearby particles.

Installation & Running

No installation is required! Simply open life.html in any modern web browser.

Technologies Used

HTML5 for structure

CSS3 for styling and layout

JavaScript (Vanilla) for particle simulation and interactivity

Customization

Modify the default values of forces and radii in the JavaScript section.

Adjust the particle colors in the groupColors object.

Experiment with different interaction rules to create unique behaviors.
