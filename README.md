# Interactive Particle Simulation

This project is an interactive **particle simulation** that allows users to control and observe the behavior of different particle groups in real-time. Using adjustable sliders, you can modify forces, radii, and the number of particles to explore emergent behaviors and dynamic interactions.

# Project Overview

- `life.html` - The complete simulation, containing all necessary HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- `readme.md` - This file, documenting the project and how to use it.

# Features

- **Customizable Particle Groups** – Adjust the number of particles for each color group.
- **Dynamic Forces & Radii** – Control how different particles attract or repel each other.
- **Interactive Sidebar** – Modify parameters in real-time using sliders.
- **Bounded vs. Free Movement** – Choose whether particles stay within the canvas or wrap around.
- **Mouse Interaction** – Dragging influences particles near the cursor.

# How to Use

1. **Open `life.html` in a web browser.** No installations required!
2. **Click "START/RESET"** to begin the simulation.
3. **Adjust sliders** to change the behavior of the particles.
4. **Observe the emergent patterns** created by the interaction settings.

# Customization Options

- **Number of Particles**: Increase or decrease the number of particles per group.
- **Interaction Forces**: Set attraction/repulsion strength between particle groups.
- **Interaction Radii**: Define how far particles interact with others.
- **Boundary Mode**: Toggle whether particles are confined or wrap around the edges.
- **Mouse Influence**: Move the mouse while clicking to attract or repel particles.

# Why This Project?

This simulation provides a **fun and educational** way to explore **physics-based interactions** and **emergent behavior** using simple rules. Whether you're experimenting with particle systems, interested in artificial life, or just enjoy watching cool visualizations, this project is a great way to learn!

# Future Enhancements (Ideas)

- Add **more color groups** with unique behaviors.
- Introduce **gravity or environmental factors**.
- Implement **particle trails** for a more visually appealing effect.
- Allow **saving and loading presets** for different interaction settings.
